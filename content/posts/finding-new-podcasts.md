I am a little biased in my podcast listening, or more I highly prefer small queer made podcasts that might end up becoming popular. It's like fanfic, the creators put so much effort and love for the joy of creating a story. Because podcasts can be simple to make on a low/no budget, it gives a platform to those with barely any money for a microphone that normally would face barriers.

I tend to find podcasts by word of mouth, recommended from Tumblr blogs I follow and recommended by small podcast companies I follow. Special shout out to Gemini Collision Works (Life with Althaar creator) and Iris Case Files (The Strange Case of Starship Iris) on Tumblr, those two love interacting with the fandom when they can and sharing posts that recommend them that often are also recommending other podcasts. There is also the fun case of I find a voice actor I love, like Zach Valenti who is in Time:Bombs and Wolf359, who pops up in another podcast so I hunt that down and give it a listen too.

## Recommendations for me to listen to
This is more of a priority reference for myself, I have heard they're good though.

## Old tumblr post's I refer to

Here's the tumblr posts and images I refer back to when I'm looking for something new because I hate Spotify's recommendation algorithm.

## Found in 2019 on Tumblr - Source lost
I found this in 2019 when I was first getting into podcasts, I have since lost the orginal posts so I take no ownership of these. If you know the source feel free to suggest them.
