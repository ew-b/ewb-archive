## Old tumblr post's I refer to
I am a little biased in my podcast listening, or more I highly prefer small queer made podcasts that might end up becoming popular. It's like fanfic, these creators put so much effort and love for the joy of creating a story. Because the podcast medium can be so easy to make it gives a platform to those with barely any money for a microphone.

So that's to say, here's the tumblr posts and images I refer back to when I'm looking for something new because I hate Spotify's recommendation algorithm.
