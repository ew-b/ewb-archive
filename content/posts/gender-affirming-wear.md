## Binders, guides and safety {#binders-guides-and-safety}

Following information all from: [https://www.transhealthto.com/bind-safe](https://www.transhealthto.com/bind-safe) 


### General Information {#general-information}



* Pay attention to your body. You should always be able to breathe comfortably while wearing your binder. If it starts to hurt when you take a deep breath, or if it feels too tight, take the binder off immediately.
* Readjust your chest in your binder, lifting up or adjusting till you’re happy with the shape.
* Only bind for 8 hours at a time maximum and never sleep in your binder.
* Take break days from your binder every couple of days. Wearing a sports bra or layering shirts can be a good alternative.
* Wear a sports bra instead of a binder when doing physical activity. A binder isn’t built to move with your body, so it could cause harm when worn during extreme physical activity.
* Fun tip, you CAN swim in your binder!
* Wash your binder regularly and follow the cleaning care instructions provided by the manufacturer.
* Do not wear a binder that is too small for you, as this can cause injury, and won’t function as well as a binder that is the right size for you. Refer to the recommended size guides provided by binder companies. Each company is going to be a little different, so make sure that you read them carefully.
* After removing your binder, make sure to stretch out your arms, shoulders, chest, and back to loosen any tightness, and be sure to take a few deep breaths and cough to clear out any possible fluid build-up in your lungs.


### Signs you may need to take a break from binding {#signs-you-may-need-to-take-a-break-from-binding}



* Chest pains/ difficulty breathing.
* Numbness, tingling.
* Overheating; dehydration.
* Skin rash, irritation, sores.
* Back pain, soreness.


### Effects of binding from ‘Bind-safe’ {#effects-of-binding-from-‘bind-safe’}

The following excerpts are from Bind-Safe, a trans health campaign from ‘TransHealthTO’ - [https://www.transhealthto.com/bind-safe](https://www.transhealthto.com/bind-safe) 


    “Chest binding can often begin in adolescence as an avenue to further explore gender identity. 


    Although there is no known paediatric “safe age” to start binding, a recent study was conducted wich enrolled 1,800 assigned female at birth or intersex individuals who had ever used chest binding (6). In this survey (“The Binding Health Project”), more than one-half (56%) of participants had begun binding by age 21, and 30% had begun by age 18 (6).


    Although many symptoms of binding emerge quickly, others can take years to develop. For youth, access to puberty blockers may delay the initiation of binding and prevent binding-related side effects from emerging. Although binding is often critical for mental health, negative physical side effects, ranging from chronic pain to rib fractures, are also common (6).”


            _The study they are referring to: [https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2021/02/03/peds.2020-0728?fbclid=IwAR2WoAG5z4IaLc9rb4-LLxCeN45yHNj7616ThN3L_ets9YpjqGkoMoanbCw](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2021/02/03/peds.2020-0728?fbclid=IwAR2WoAG5z4IaLc9rb4-LLxCeN45yHNj7616ThN3L_ets9YpjqGkoMoanbCw) _


    “The 2017 study found that almost 9 in 10 people experienced at least one negative effect from binding, and 8 out of 10 felt that it was important to discuss binding with a healthcare provider. However, only 3 in 20 (15%) sought medical care for binding-related health issues (3).


    Over half of the participants report that their healthcare practitioner is aware that they bind their chests, but among those, less than half actually discussed their binding practices with their provider. People who felt safe and comfortable about starting a conversation about binding, were more likely to seek help for any negative binding side effects (3). This highlights the disparity between the healthcare that transgender and non-binary people need, versus the healthcare that they have access to or feel safe to pursue.”


    	_The study they are referring to: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27300085/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27300085/) _

### Measuring for your size {#measuring-for-your-size}



* Take a snug measurement of the fullest part of your chest.
* Measure underneath your chest, where the crease is.
* Add those two measurements together and divide the sum by two and that is your
* binder size.
* Make sure to double-check and follow the instructions provided by the brand of your
* binder, as some brands may require a different method of measurement for sizing.

### Zipper Binders {#zipper-binders}

Zipper binders are great for those who need that added accessibility of putting a binder on or taking it off, it also helps with quickly removing them - if you’ve been trapped on your binder on a hot summer's day you know what I mean. 

On the safety of zippers (they are safe! It’s about the fabric not what’s holding it together)

### Tape Binding {#tape-binding}

Tape binding is an option for those that want the appearance of not wearing anything under their shirt, it offers more range of movement and can be worn for several days. However, please cover your nipples with tissue/cotton pads/nipple pasties to protect them as tape can do damage to the nipples skin. Additionally many have sensitivity to tape, patch test it on a different area of your body or a small section to see how your skin responds. And use oils when removing the tape so it’s not a painful experience removing it.

## Gaffs and Tucking Wear {#gaffs-and-tucking-wear}

**_Note from Eli: I am not trans femme or a trans woman, the following is based on my own research and suggestions. Please comment or message me if you want something added!_**

_The following information is from Trans Youth Equality, a UK organisation._

_[http://www.transyouthequality.org/tucking](http://www.transyouthequality.org/tucking) _


### Tucking {#tucking}

A popular way to tuck is using a gaff. Gaffs help tuck everything back, ensuring your tuck is completely secure.


### **Safety** {#safety}



* Always remember: if anything hurts, stop IMMEDIATELY and return after a break. 
* DON’T FORCE any body parts to move in an unnatural or painful position. 
* See a doctor if you have concerns about complications with tucking.
* Test out your tuck at home, and wear it around for a bit while you’re in privacy. This way, if you have any problems, you can fix them now instead of having to deal with them in public. 
* Start out slow and be careful. This will take some getting used to, so you may make some mistakes at first. It’s always best to be slow and cautious.


### Guide to tucking with a gaff {#guide-to-tucking-with-a-gaff}



1. Put your legs through the gaff’s holes just like with underwear. Start to pull the gaff to your upper thighs. Gaffs are worn underneath underwear.
2. You’ll want to GENTLY push the testicles up with two or three fingers into your body. They will pop into two sockets called the inguinal canal, which is where they sat originally before birth. You may experience some discomfort at first, but it shouldn’t be painful and this will become quite natural (remember - if you experience pain, stop immediately and take a break. Consult a medical professional for severe or persistent pain or discomfort).
3. Then, use your hand to GENTLY tuck everything else back. Ensure that everything is tucked back and nothing is hanging out the side of the gaff centrepiece, since this could be painful. Never pull or tug on any body parts.
4. Keep everything secured with your hand while pulling up the gaff completely. You may have to readjust your tuck as you pull up the gaff.
5. Make sure everything feels comfortable and secure. Pull the straps of the gaff backwards to make the front extra smooth. You may have some mild discomfort, but if you feel any real pain readjust until it feels better. If the pain persists, stop and take a break.
6. You should take occasional breaks from tucking to prevent chafing. Never sleep or play sports while tucked. 
7. Loose-fitting clothes like flowy skirts and dresses often conceal this region, so you may find that you don’t need to tuck while wearing these types of clothes!


### Tucking with Tape {#tucking-with-tape}

Some people prefer to use tape instead of gaffs or tucking underwear. Tape can be a bit more complicated because you have to take it off when you go to the bathroom. Taking it off can also pull and cause pain or discomfort.

If you want to try tape, keep these important tips in mind:



* Use medical-grade tape from a pharmacy or medical professional.
* Absolutely no packing tape, duct tape, etc. Any tape that is really strong and not meant for the skin could cause injury. 
* Test out your tuck at home, and wear it around for a bit while you’re in privacy. This way, if you have any problems, you can fix them now instead of having to deal with them in public.
* Start out slow and be careful. This will take some getting used to, so you may make some mistakes at first. It’s always best to be slow and cautious.


### Make your own gaff {#make-your-own-gaff}



* Safely cut out an elastic band from a pair of tights or underwear, but preferably underwear. For making gaffs, use underwear about 2 sizes larger than your usual size.
* Safely cut out the top part of a tube or crew sock, or a rectangular section of tights / leggings. Make sure that this piece isn’t too short, because having more fabric can help secure everything! However, you also don’t want it to be too long where it gets bulky.
* Put the elastic band through the hole in the fabric and position the fabric in the middle. That’s it! Your legs will go in the 2 holes on either side of the middle fabric section.
* Wearing a pantyliner can help create a smoother appearance.
