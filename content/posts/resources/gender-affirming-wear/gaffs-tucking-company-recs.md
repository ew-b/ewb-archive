## Tucking {#tucking}

A popular way to tuck is using a gaff. Gaffs help tuck everything back, ensuring your tuck is completely secure.


### Safety {#safety}

* Always remember: if anything hurts, stop IMMEDIATELY and return after a break. 
* DON’T FORCE any body parts to move in an unnatural or painful position. 
* See a doctor if you have concerns about complications with tucking.
* Test out your tuck at home, and wear it around for a bit while you’re in privacy. This way, if you have any problems, you can fix them now instead of having to deal with them in public. 
* Start out slow and be careful. This will take some getting used to, so you may make some mistakes at first. It’s always best to be slow and cautious.


### Guide to tucking with a gaff {#guide-to-tucking-with-a-gaff}


1. Put your legs through the gaff’s holes just like with underwear. Start to pull the gaff to your upper thighs. Gaffs are worn underneath underwear.
2. You’ll want to GENTLY push the testicles up with two or three fingers into your body. They will pop into two sockets called the inguinal canal, which is where they sat originally before birth. You may experience some discomfort at first, but it shouldn’t be painful and this will become quite natural (remember - if you experience pain, stop immediately and take a break. Consult a medical professional for severe or persistent pain or discomfort).
3. Then, use your hand to GENTLY tuck everything else back. Ensure that everything is tucked back and nothing is hanging out the side of the gaff centrepiece, since this could be painful. Never pull or tug on any body parts.
4. Keep everything secured with your hand while pulling up the gaff completely. You may have to readjust your tuck as you pull up the gaff.
5. Make sure everything feels comfortable and secure. Pull the straps of the gaff backwards to make the front extra smooth. You may have some mild discomfort, but if you feel any real pain readjust until it feels better. If the pain persists, stop and take a break.
6. You should take occasional breaks from tucking to prevent chafing. Never sleep or play sports while tucked. 
7. Loose-fitting clothes like flowy skirts and dresses often conceal this region, so you may find that you don’t need to tuck while wearing these types of clothes!


### Tucking with Tape {#tucking-with-tape}

Some people prefer to use tape instead of gaffs or tucking underwear. Tape can be a bit more complicated because you have to take it off when you go to the bathroom. Taking it off can also pull and cause pain or discomfort.

If you want to try tape, keep these important tips in mind:

* Use medical-grade tape from a pharmacy or medical professional.
* Absolutely no packing tape, duct tape, etc. Any tape that is really strong and not meant for the skin could cause injury. 
* Test out your tuck at home, and wear it around for a bit while you’re in privacy. This way, if you have any problems, you can fix them now instead of having to deal with them in public.
* Start out slow and be careful. This will take some getting used to, so you may make some mistakes at first. It’s always best to be slow and cautious.


### Make your own gaff {#make-your-own-gaff}

* Safely cut out an elastic band from a pair of tights or underwear, but preferably underwear. For making gaffs, use underwear about 2 sizes larger than your usual size.
* Safely cut out the top part of a tube or crew sock, or a rectangular section of tights / leggings. Make sure that this piece isn’t too short, because having more fabric can help secure everything! However, you also don’t want it to be too long where it gets bulky.
* Put the elastic band through the hole in the fabric and position the fabric in the middle. That’s it! Your legs will go in the 2 holes on either side of the middle fabric section.
* Wearing a pantyliner can help create a smoother appearance.
