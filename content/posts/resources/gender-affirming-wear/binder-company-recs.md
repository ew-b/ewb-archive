### Measuring for your binder size {#measuring-for-your-size}

* Take a snug measurement of the fullest part of your chest.
* Measure underneath your chest, where the crease is.
* Add those two measurements together and divide the sum by two and that is your binder size.
* Make sure to double-check and follow the instructions provided by the brand of your
* binder, as some brands may require a different method of measurement for sizing.

## Tape Binding {#tape-binding}

Tape binding is an option for those that want the appearance of not wearing anything under their shirt, it offers more range of movement and can be worn for several days. However, please cover your nipples with tissue/cotton pads/nipple pasties to protect them as tape can do damage to the nipples skin. Additionally many have sensitivity to tape, patch test it on a different area of your body or a small section to see how your skin responds. And use oils when removing the tape so it’s not a painful experience removing it. 

Guide to tape binding can be read on [TransTape's website](https://transtape.life/pages/how-to-transtape).
