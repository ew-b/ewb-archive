### [King Falls AM](https://open.spotify.com/show/7fIe7hsmj65WhwIuJHWCSh?si=oMPdMb_ETROCZGRSnPlMWg)

**Genre/theme:** supernatural, hills have eyes (kinda), spooky, comedy, fiction

**Status:** Permanently unfinished 

**CW:** 

Looking for a small American quirky town radioshow that covers alien abductions, werewolves, and the strange happenings? This is a fiction podcast that is super queer positive and never ceases to make me laugh (and sometimes cry from the emotional depth it hits with its characters).

**Status:** Finished

**CW**: bugs, body horror, monsters in the dark, delusions, paranoia, losing identity, buried alive, burning/ fires, dismissing horror for mental illness, ringing sound effects.

Spooky graphic horror based in Britain, hella episodic at the start and gives me the fucking creeps when I listen to it in the dark so caution. Has overarching plot and heavily horror, note that the first 100 episodes do not have trigger warnings (see their wiki for all episode trigger warnings), this podcast can be incredibly triggering for bugs, body horror, monsters in the dark, delusions, paranoia, losing identity, buried alive, burning/ fires etc, while it aims to be horror and not trauma it can be traumatic if you’re not prepared.

**CW:** 

Drop outs of a late stage capitalistic society and fucked government are now on charge of taking care of a transport ship holding thousands of people in cryosleep. Meme of a podcast, funny as hell and makes you think ‘what the fuck’ regularly. Not inherently queer I don’t think (that’s a lie, there is one non-binary character)

Don't let sitcom stop you, it's just has long form episodes instead of short 20 minute episodes. Based on a space station, primarily funny, heart breaking at times. It’s a comedy sci-fi soap opera that is incredibly complex but has really strong plot, setting and background - trust me there is overarching plot.
